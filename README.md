Created to learn how to use GitHub

Hello, fellow programmers!

I'm learning how to use Git because I created a program for my workplace, and I want to develop it and keep track of changes along the way. I've created and have been maintaining a changelog with Notepad manually. When I heard that there is a program that does that for you, I had to check it out. Plus, I also read that it is beneficial to know how to use Git if I want to get a programming job.
